**Socket.io Server Deployment Repository**
=====================================

Welcome to our Socket.io server deployment repository!

**About this repository**
------------------------

This repository contains the source code for a Socket.io server, designed to be deployed on a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) virtual machine. 
The server is written in Node.js and utilizes the Socket.io library to establish real-time communication between clients.

**Overview of the project**
----------------------------

The Socket.io server is a robust and scalable solution for real-time data synchronization and communication between clients. 
It allows for bi-directional communication between the server and clients, enabling features such as:

* Real-time updates
* Live chat functionality
* File sharing
* And more!

**Server-side functionality**
-------------------------

The server-side code is written in Node.js and utilizes the Express.js framework to handle incoming requests and send responses. 
The Socket.io library is used to establish WebSocket connections with clients.

Here's a high-level overview of the server-side functionality:

* Handles incoming requests from clients
* Establishes WebSocket connections using Socket.io
* Broadcasts updates to connected clients
* Handles file uploads and downloads
* Manages user authentication and authorization

**Deployment**
-------------

To deploy this repository on a GCP virtual machine, follow these steps:

1. Create a new GCP project and enable the Compute Engine API.
2. Create a new instance of a virtual machine (VM) using a suitable operating system (e.g., Ubuntu).
3. Install Node.js and npm on the VM.
4. Clone this repository to the VM using `git clone <repository-url>`.
5. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
6. Run `node server.js` to start the server.
